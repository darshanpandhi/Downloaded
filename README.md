# What are the Characteristics of Most Popular Apps

This paper aims to find out what it takes to be popular, at least in the Android application market. With the number of mobile apps reaching unprecedented levels, the success rate is dwindling. Hence, the goal of this paper is to help future developers by supplying them with a list of factors to take extra care of while building their next mobile application. This paper is written in contrast to "What are the Characteristics of High-Rated Apps? A Case Study on Free Android Applications" [1].  Thus, it follows the same methodology albeit with a modern refresh thanks to the large new dataset consisting of over 80 thousand apps and more importantly, the number of downloads being the success metric.
8 factors are subjected to a survey by end-users, statistical experiments and a random forest classifier to understand every little relation they have with number of downloads. Together, with the factors identified by Yuan et al., a recipe for app success is discovered. This secret recipe identifies the number of promotional images/videos, install size of an app and its ratings as the most cardinal factors to achieving a mobile app developer's goal.
